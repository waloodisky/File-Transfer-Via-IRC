Transfering files over IRC by turning the file's binary into ascii, splitting the data into messages of 400 letters and sending them.
the reciever.py code decodes the ascii into the original binary and saves it as a file in the current directory.
To use either the sender code or the reciever code you need to change the variables at the start of each file.
